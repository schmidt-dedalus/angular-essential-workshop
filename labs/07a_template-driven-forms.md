## Using Angular Validators

In this exercise you will validate the entries in the search form of the `FlightSearchComponent` with the built-in validators `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength` and `pattern` and output any validation errors.

You can use the following procedure as a guide:

1. Make sure that the search fields are in a `form` element and set up a handle for this element. Also make sure that each input field has a `name` attribute.

   <details>
   <summary>Show source</summary>
   <p>

   ```html
   <form #flightSearchForm="ngForm">
     [...]
     <input name="from" [(ngModel)]="from" [...] />
     [...]
     <input name="to" [(ngModel)]="to" [...] />
     [...]
   </form>
   ```

   </p>
   </details>

2. Extend the search field `from` to include the validation attributes mentioned above and report any validation errors.

   <details>
   <summary>Show source</summary>
   <p>

   ```html
   <input name="from" [(ngModel)]="from" required minlength="3" maxlength="15" pattern="[a-zA-ZäöüÄÖÜß ]*" />

   <pre *ngIf="flightSearchForm.controls['from']">{{ flightSearchForm.controls['from'].errors | json }}</pre>

   [...]
   <div *ngIf="flightSearchForm.controls['from']?.hasError('minlength')" class="text-danger">... minlength ...</div>
   [...]
   ```

   </p>
   </details>

3. Test your solution

## Reusable component for displaying the validation errors \*

In order not to have to query the validation errors in the same way over and over again for each input field, it is advisable to use a central component.

1. Let's start with generating the new component:

```
ng g c flight-booking/flight-validation-errors
```

2. The component can receive the property `errors` of the validated `FormControl`. For example, the expression `flightSearchForm.controls['from'].errors` returns the following object if both the validator `minlength` and a possibly self-written`city` validator fail:

```json
{
  "minlength": {
    "requiredLength": 3,
    "actualLength": 1
  },
  "city": true
}
```

3. Implement the component, so that it receives this `errors` object (`@Input({ required: true }) errors: ValidationErrors | null = null;`) and outputs an error message for each of the errors in it. Please note that `null` is used internally when there are no errors. To check whether this object exists and whether it indicates a specific error, `*ngIf` can be used:

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="errors">
  <div *ngIf="errors['required']" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">This field is required.</div>

  <div *ngIf="errors['minlength']" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">This field is too short.</div>

  <!--[...]-->
</ng-container>
```

4. To make this component reusable for different fields, you might want to add another input for the field name like (`@Input() fieldLabel = 'Field';`). Now you can also use the same component for the `to` field and also later for Reactive Forms.

5. This component should be able to be called up as follows:

```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label>From</label>
  <input class="form-control" name="from" [(ngModel)]="from" required minlength="3" />

  <app-flight-validation-errors
    *ngIf="flightSearchForm.controls['from']"
    [errors]="flightSearchForm.controls['from'].errors"
    fieldLabel="From"
  />
</div>
```

## Bonus: When to show errors

Currently, you can probably see the errors immediately if your fields `from` and `to` are empty. Is this a good solution? If not how would you improve this?
